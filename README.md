# Java-Lab-006

## PART 1

In this README.md, answer the following question:

* What happens if you invoke a value method (i.e. a method that returns a result) and don't do anything with the returned result; that is, if you don't assign the returned result to a variable or use it as part of a larger expression?
//Nothing will happen, it won't be used.

## PART 2
* Fork and clone this lab as you have done in all previous labs, and then complete the following:
    * Create a new **class** called **Lab006**
    * Create two **int**eger instance variables for class Lab006 called **n** and **m**.
    * Create a **constructor** for class **Lab006** that takes two **int**egers, **n** and **m** and assigns them to Lab006 **instance variables**.
        * "takes two integers" means that the constructor method must have **two parameters** of the appropriate data type.
    * Write a **public**/instance method named, **isDivisible**, that references, instance variables **n** and **m**, and **returns true** if **n** is evenly divisible by **m**, and **false** otherwise.
        * Hint: remember that `x % 2 == 0`, means that x is evenly divisible by 2.
    * In a **static main** method, **prompt the user for two integers and store those values into local variables**.
    * Use the local variables as the **arguments** to the Lab006 **constructor** when creating a **new Lab006** *object*.
    * Call **isDivisible using a Lab006 object**, and be sure to have code that "handles" the returned value from **isDivisible**.
        * Use one of the "handling" techniques as demonstrated at the top of pg 86 or on pg 93 of ThinkJava as a reference for how to handle a returned value.
    * Use a print command to display an appropriate label and the result of isDivisible.

## PART 3

* Add javadocs to your code Including programmer identifying comments at the top of your class.
     * Also add javadoc definitions for your **methods** and **parameters**.
     * Javadocs can be started in IntelliJ above each method with `/**` and upon hitting enter will auto-populate some content for you.
* Javadocs are not just important for self-documenting your code, but they are also used by other tools, like your IDE, to provide **usage** help to users of your code.

## PART 4

* Make sure to use the Git tab at the bottom of IntelliJ to create a Spring2023 feature branch
* Commit and Push your running code back to your GitHub account
* Issue a Pull request back to my Java-Lab-006 repo
* Cut and Paste the Pull request URL into your Canvas lab to turn it in.
